      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a transition that&amp;rsquo;s been rehashed by many before me: going from developer to manager. I&amp;rsquo;ve been making this transition over the last six months at Cratejoy and thought I&amp;rsquo;d share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far.
For context, Cratejoy is a relatively small startup with about a dozen engineers. Before myself, there had only been two other engineering managers (our CTO and my boss). You could definitely say my &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; was ad hoc.</description>
