      <title>Tech&#39;s Ethical Negligence</title>

      <description>Tech is at a cross-roads. The move fast and break things mantra of Silicon Valley is actually breaking things.
Regardless of whether or not the people making the decisions at Facebook were bad actors (or negligent), the hands building this stuff have a responsibility as well. Despite how smart the engineers of the world think we are, we&amp;rsquo;re still easily manipulated and blinded by an idealistic vision. The hands that built these platforms may have only intended good to flow from their existence.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a transition that&amp;rsquo;s been rehashed by many before me: going from developer to manager. I&amp;rsquo;ve been making this transition over the last six months at Cratejoy and thought I&amp;rsquo;d share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far.
For context, Cratejoy is a relatively small startup with about a dozen engineers. Before myself, there had only been two other engineering managers (our CTO and my boss). You could definitely say my &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; was ad hoc.</description>
